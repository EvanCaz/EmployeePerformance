## ℹ️ Overview

I created a Java Swing App that visualizes employee metrics for readability. It parse a excel file saved as a csv, gathers all the employee information, and displays it dynamically. Each employee is assigned a unique color and their data is plotted on the graph. The user can change the range of the graph, and it will also update accordingly to the months present in the csv file. Additionally, features like expected performance for each employee will also be plotted. The graph is in real time and updates at the users leisure. 

## 🚀 Usage instructions

Currently a jar file, this program requires the user to have a Java Runtime Enviroment install locally and is reachable. The program is straight forward, with no discernable ambiguity in what each function does. Eventually, when I figure it out, I will create a .exe file for simple use
