## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

This Java Swing application visualizes employee performance metrics from CSV data through an interactive line graph. Users select a CSV file via a file dialog, which is parsed to extract employee names and monthly performance values. The GUI dynamically displays color-coded data points for selected employees, with hover tooltips showing exact values. Features include adjustable Y-axis ranges, toggling individual/all employees, and a dropdown for employee selection. Unique colors are algorithmically assigned to each employee for clarity, and the graph updates in real-time based on user interactions. Built with Java‚Äôs Swing library, it emphasizes usability for exploring performance trends across customizable timeframes.
