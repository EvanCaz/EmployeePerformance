# 📄 Employee Perfromance Line Graph in Java with Swing

- Created by Evan Cazares for use at MWM Design Group

## ℹ️ Overview

Encompassed in 1.0, I created a Java Swing App that visualizes employee metrics for readability. It parse a excel file saved as a csv, gathers all the employee information, and displays it dynamically. Each employee is assigned a unique color and their data is plotted on the graph. The user can change the range of the graph, and it will also update accordingly to the months present in the csv file. The graph is in real time and updates at the users leisure. 

1.1 will have expected performance plotted, as well as potential issues/edge cases I have thought off handled correctly.

## 🚀 Usage instructions

Currently a jar file, this program requires the user to have a Java Runtime Enviroment install locally and is reachable. The program is straight forward, with no discernable ambiguity in what each function does. Eventually, when I figure it out, I will create a .exe file for simple use that has the JRE bundled.
